Website: https://dimaparamonovv.github.io/Weather/

Created a weather app, using only HTML, CSS and JS.

When you visit this website for the first time, you can see a weather in a default city (New-York). 
But actually, you can input any city that you want. 
Also, you can see some additional information about weather (wind, humidity, pressure).
